"""OP (Orienteering Problem) arithmetic instance-feasibility check.

An OP instance is feasible iff:

  1. All node coordinates lie in the rl4co unit-square             (locs ∈ [0, 1]²)
  2. All prizes are non-negative                                   (`prize >= 0`)
  3. The depot prize is zero or unset                              (depot has no reward)
  4. The travel budget is strictly positive                        (`max_length > 0`)
  5. The budget is at least the round-trip distance to one customer
     (otherwise no tour beyond the depot is feasible; we use the
     minimum depot-to-customer round trip as a tight lower bound)

These are *necessary* conditions; satisfying them does NOT prove
that a high-prize tour exists (that needs the OP CP-SAT decision
query in `op_cp.py`). They catch every infeasibility a small
Gaussian perturbation around a valid instance would produce
(negative prizes, budgets shrunken below the depot-round-trip,
locations pushed outside the unit square), which is the common
case during counterfactual search.

Returns `[B]` bool tensor; `True` = candidate passes all checks.

"""FJSP (Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling) arithmetic instance-feasibility check.

An FJSP instance is feasible iff:

  1. Processing times are non-negative on every (machine, op) cell
                                                       (`proc_times >= 0`)
  2. Every real (non-padded) op has at least one eligible machine
                                                       (`num_eligible[o] >= 1`)
  3. The eligibility mask is consistent with `proc_times`
     -- ineligible cells carry processing time zero
        (rl4co stores `proc_times[m, o] = 0` when (m, o) is not eligible)
  4. The padding mask is monotonic: padded ops appear contiguously at the
     end of the op axis (`pad_mask[o] == True` implies `pad_mask[o'] == True`
     for every o' > o within the same instance). rl4co's generator enforces
     this, so a perturbation that violates it indicates a corrupted state.

These are *necessary* conditions; they do not prove that a feasible
schedule exists (the CP-SAT decision query in `fjsp_cp.py` upgrades
the certificate). They catch the failure modes a small Gaussian
perturbation around a valid instance would produce -- negative
processing times, eligibility-mask drift, and padding desync.

Returns `[B]` bool tensor; `True` = candidate passes all checks.
